# Country Data Project

This project consists of two main parts: a backend API (`country-data-backend`) and a frontend dashboard (`country-data-dashboard`).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run both the backend and frontend components of the project.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd country-data-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you've configured).

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window/tab

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd country-data-dashboard
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/3001` (or the next available port if 3000 is already in use by the backend).

## Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running:
- The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
- The frontend dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000/3001` (or the next available port)

Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL to interact with the Country Data Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that the specified ports are not in use by other applications
3. Verify that the backend URL is correctly configured in the frontend application
